SQL supports various data types to represent different kinds of data, including numbers, text, dates, and more. Here are some common data types in SQL:

1. **Numeric Data Types:**
   - `INT`: Represents integer values.
   - `FLOAT` or `REAL`: Represents floating-point numbers.
   - `DECIMAL` or `NUMERIC`: Represents fixed-point numbers with a specified precision and scale.
   - `BIGINT`: Represents large integer values.
   - `SMALLINT`: Represents small integer values.
   
2. **Character String Data Types:**
   - `CHAR(n)`: Represents fixed-length character strings of length `n`.
   - `VARCHAR(n)`: Represents variable-length character strings with a maximum length of `n`.
   - `TEXT`: Represents variable-length character strings with no specified maximum length.

3. **Date and Time Data Types:**
   - `DATE`: Represents a date (year, month, and day).
   - `TIME`: Represents a time of day.
   - `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP`: Represents a combination of date and time.
   - `INTERVAL`: Represents a time interval or duration.

4. **Boolean Data Type:**
   - `BOOLEAN` or `BOOL`: Represents true or false values.

5. **Binary Data Types:**
   - `BINARY(n)`: Represents fixed-length binary data of length `n`.
   - `VARBINARY(n)`: Represents variable-length binary data with a maximum length of `n`.
   - `BLOB`: Represents binary large objects for storing large binary data like images or documents.

6. **Enumerated Data Type:**
   - `ENUM`: Represents a set of predefined values that a column can take.

7. **JSON Data Types:**
   - `JSON`: Represents JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data.
   - `JSONB`: Represents binary JSON data, which is more efficient for querying.

8. **Geospatial Data Types (in some databases):**
   - `GEOMETRY`, `POINT`, `LINESTRING`, `POLYGON`, etc.: Used for storing and querying geographic and geometric data.

9. **Custom/User-Defined Data Types (in some databases):**
   - Some database systems allow you to define your own custom data types to suit specific needs.

10. **Array Data Types (in some databases):**
    - Arrays can hold multiple values of the same data type.

These are some of the common data types you'll encounter in SQL. 
The specific data types and their syntax may vary slightly between different database management systems 
(e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server), so it's essential to refer to the documentation of the database 
you are using for precise details on data types and their usage.
